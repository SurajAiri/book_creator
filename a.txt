Developed a platform that generates entire books using locally installed Large Language Models (LLMs) based on user-defined genre and context.
Integrated LangChain for natural language processing and implemented both CLI and Streamlit GUI options for book generation.
Allowed users to customize the LLM model used, supporting any locally installed models with adaptable parameters such as temperature for content creativity.
Managed project dependencies with Poetry and set up environments using Conda for seamless execution.
